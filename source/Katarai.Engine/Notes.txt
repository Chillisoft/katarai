  - Highest Passed (Edge Cases missed)
  - Number of Passes

 - (Find level of tests)
  - Highest consecutive level passed
  - Highest Passed

Compare Levels and make verdict on code....
(TL = Test Level ; IL = Implementation Level)
 - If Match then at Beginning of RGR cycle
 - If TL < IL then moved too far - "Over Implemented, is there something smaller you can do?"
 - If TL = IL + 1 then we are finished the R phase
 - If TL > IL + 1 then test too big - "Can you find a smaller change to test for?"
